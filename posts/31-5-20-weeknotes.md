I have a terrible memory. At work, I am careful to document the meetings I have and what is said in them, but I can't say the same for my personal or creative life. And that's a shame! I would like to better recall what I've been doing and what I've been feeling. 

So this is what I've been up to this week:

* Preparing a syllabus for [Toolkits: Digital Storytelling](https://expressmedia.org.au/programs/toolkits/toolkits-digital-storytelling/). It's a total dream to be preparing materials for young writers interested in experimental digital writing, and I am savouring this process as much as possible. [I wrote about my relationship with Toolkits and with electronic literature for Voiceworks last year](https://www.voiceworksmag.com.au/all/ex-stream-ly-online), and am just beyond stoked to get to learn, share and listen with others in a couple months. If you live in Australia and are under 30, you should [apply](https://expressmedia.submittable.com/submit/166528/toolkits-digital-storytelling-2020)! I promise it will be great.
* Working on a commission I'm not sure I can share yet, but has been really fulfilling to write so far. At this stage, it will build off of the same structures of generative poems I've published before ('[futurity blues](http://rundog.art/news/futurity-blues/)', '[sentiment anomaly](https://www.theliftedbrow.com/liftedbrow/2020/1/12/pproujynrq3mc96e8kzw2ghuv08kz7)') but still be its own weird thing. Earlier this week I finished Scott Rettberg's Electronic Literature, which contains a chapter on combinatory poetry. It's a fascinating historical overview of generative text, and has amplified the rich possibilities of the form.
* Walking! This week has been wet and wintry, and I spent most of the week indoors. Yesterday I met up with a friend and walked around unfamiliar streets in the city, lapping up the return of sunshine to my life. It's been the first time I've been out with a friend since COVID-19 lockdown began, and it felt fucking good.

Here is a selection of what I've been (re)reading:

* [Things We Inscribed in the Voyager Golden Record](https://rundog.art/poetry/things-we-inscribed-in-the-voyager-golden-record-shastra-deo/) by Shastra Deo for Running Dog
* [What football will look like in the future](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjL16DIz93pAhXT7XMBHWaSBI8QFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbnation.com%2Fa%2F17776-football&usg=AOvVaw0-TK4_3FqJdpwaf6Hfgdaa) by Jon Bois for SB Nation
* [The Typescript Stops Here, Or: Who does the Consultant Consult?](https://meanjin.com.au/essays/the-typescript-stops-here-or-who-does-the-consultant-consult/) by Gerald Murnane for Meanjin
