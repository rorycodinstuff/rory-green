Hi! I'm Rory Green.

I'm a writer, editor and casual coder who lives and works on [Gadigal land](https://www.sydneybarani.com.au/sites/aboriginal-people-and-place/).

## Arts work

Currently:
- Online Editor for [Voiceworks](https://www.voiceworksmag.com.au/)
- Zine Fair Coordinator for [National Young Writers Festival](https://youngwritersfestival.org/)

Previously:
- Codirector for [Subbed In](https://subbed.in/)


## Writing

I primarily write poetry and electronic literature about memory, place and pop culture. In 2016 I took part in Express Media's inaugural [Toolkits :Poetry program](https://expressmedia.org.au/news/introducing-the-poets-of-toolkits/), and in 2019 I was selected for Running Dog's [inaugural poetry micro-residency](http://rundog.art/news/announcing-running-dogs-inaugural-poetry-micro-residents/).

Some of my writing includes:
- *futurity blues*, [Running Dog](http://rundog.art/news/futurity-blues/)
- *mammoth*, [Rabbit Poetry issue 24, LGBTQIA+](http://rabbitpoetry.com/?product=rabbit-24-lgbtqia-within-australia)
- *golem*, [Plumwood Mountain Volume 5 Number 2](https://plumwoodmountain.com/golem/)

My current main writing project is [Otherwise Pokedex](https://tinyletter.com/otherwisepokedex), a Tinyletter I have been publishing since January 2017 with the aim to publish a poem for each of the 151 first generation Pokemon.

I also make zines! My infozines are free to download and distribute:
- [Make computer-generated poems, fiction and bots with Tracery](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JGFwdwIIlpFUJd4rySR1XuFr5yGoQxhv)

- [Making narrative games with Bitsy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kHHyb0tYu7HlUpAXleTAHvMVC8kWIBB0)
