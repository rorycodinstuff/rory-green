Hi! I'm Rory Green.

I'm a writer, editor and digital media who lives and works on [Wangal land](https://www.sydneybarani.com.au/sites/aboriginal-people-and-place/).

My main creative practice revolves around interactive and generative digital poetry. My poetry generator forecast assemblage was a finalist in the [2022 Goolugatup Heathcote Digital Art Prize](https://www.goolugatup-heathcote.com.au/digital-art-prize), and my collaborative generative poem [Trace Garden](https://rundog.art/forecast-assemblage-an-incantation-device-alex-kelly-david-pledger/) was presented at the [2022 Cementa Art Festival](https://cementa.com.au/).

Some of my other published work includes:

* *gengar*, [Cordite Poetry Review](http://cordite.org.au/poetry/propaganda/gengar/)
* UP, [Taper](https://taper.badquar.to/6/up.html)
* *futurity blues*, [Running Dog](http://rundog.art/news/futurity-blues/)
* *sentiment anomaly*, [The Lifted Brow](https://www.theliftedbrow.com/liftedbrow/2020/1/12/pproujynrq3mc96e8kzw2ghuv08kz7)

In 2022 my first print poetry chapbook, *[the attentions](https://puncherandwattmann.com/product/the-attentions/)*, was published by Puncher & Wattmann's Slow Loris imprint.

I love teaching and mentoring, particularly across areas of interactive and multimedia writing. For the past few years I've facilitated [Toolkits: Digital Storytelling](https://expressmedia.org.au/programs/toolkits/toolkits-digital-storytelling/), and I've run workshops for Queensland Poetry, Writers SA, and Emerging Writers Festival among others.

I also have an ongoing writing project called [Otherwise Pokedex](https://tinyletter.com/otherwisepokedex), a Tinyletter I have been publishing since January 2017 with the aim to publish a poem for each of the 151 first generation Pokemon.

I write poetry and electronic literature about memory, place and media culture. In 2016 I took part in Express Media's inaugural [Toolkits: Poetry program](https://expressmedia.org.au/news/introducing-the-poets-of-toolkits/), and in 2019 I was selected for Running Dog's [inaugural poetry micro-residency](http://rundog.art/news/announcing-running-dogs-inaugural-poetry-micro-residents/).

Here are some things I have written:

*
* *mammoth*, [Rabbit Poetry issue 24, LGBTQIA+](http://rabbitpoetry.com/?product=rabbit-24-lgbtqia-within-australia)
* *golem*, [Plumwood Mountain Volume 5 Number 2](https://plumwoodmountain.com/golem/)

My current main writing project called [Otherwise Pokedex](https://tinyletter.com/otherwisepokedex), a Tinyletter I have been publishing since January 2017 with the aim to publish a poem for each of the 151 first generation Pokemon.

I also make zines! My infozines are free to download and distribute:

* [Make computer-generated poems, fiction and bots with Tracery](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JGFwdwIIlpFUJd4rySR1XuFr5yGoQxhv)
* [Little book of poem games](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F-c0ekqIv4OYX2Sj48nuTcmLzBvCXfmx)
* [Make interactive fiction with Twine](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_3mKP2mtYezO1Vk1Ac2tFjmh12LbZrul)
* [Making narrative games with Bitsy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kHHyb0tYu7HlUpAXleTAHvMVC8kWIBB0)
