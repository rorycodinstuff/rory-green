I'm Rory Green, and I'm a writer, editor and digital media artist living on unceded Gadigal land.

Some of the poems I talk about in the NWF panel 'Demystifying Experimental Poetry' can be found below.

>Naturally much of the time was spent scratching my head and had I done it again now I would probably finish it in a much shorter time, but this is also a reason why I wanted to do it, the next time I make something I might get that extra bit closer what is in my head.
